name=Nearest with greater value
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Get name (or ID) of and distance to the nearest feature with greater value in a certain field of a point layer.
            Returns point layer with added attributes and a line layer with connecting lines.
version=0.1

about=Get name (or ID) of and distance to the nearest neighbour with greater value in a certain field. Input is a points layer. 
    The main output is a points layer with added attributes nearest_gt_dist and nearest_gt_name.
    Also returns a lines layer with connecting lines, as well as basic statistics of the distances (min, max, mean, quantiles).
    Use cases: Which is the next larger city? Which is the closest peak with higher elevation? 
    Useful for spatial analysis or to categorize features in order to apply different styles (e.g. major and minor summits). 
    The distance to be returned for the feature with the greatest value can be set, 
    it should be 0 (replaced by NULL in the output) or a very large number.

    - Return additional field 'nearest_gt_count' with a count of the incoming links (i.e. connecting lines to points with smaller value)
    - Better handling of the distance value for the feature with greatest value. Three options: "NULL", "1 Mio.", "max distance + 1".
    - Warn if the selected name field contains NULL or non unique values
    - Mark more strings for translation
