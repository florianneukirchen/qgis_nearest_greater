name=Nearest with greater value
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Get name (or ID) of and distance to the nearest feature with greater value in a certain field of a point layer.
            Returns point layer with added attributes and a line layer with connecting lines.
version=0.3
author=Florian Neukirchen
email=mail@riannek.de

about=Get name (or ID) of and distance to the nearest neighbour with greater value in a certain field. Input is a points layer. 
    The main output is a points layer with added attributes neargtdist, neargtname, neargtcount. 
    The field nearest_gt_count gives the value of incoming connecting lines linking to points with smaller value.
    Also returns a lines layer with connecting lines, as well as basic statistics of the distances (min, max, mean, quantiles).
    Use cases: Which is the next larger city? Which is the closest peak with higher elevation? 
    Useful for spatial analysis or to categorize features in order to apply different styles (e.g. major and minor summits).

changelog=main branch
    - Add one more field neargtdelta with the diffence of both values
    - Improve strings in the UI
    0.3 (2022-09)
    - Fix a bug by changing the names of added fields to neargtdist, neargtname, neargtcount. Don't use underscore. Before, they were renamed by QGSIS when the layer was saved to a shapefile.
    0.2 (2022-09)
    - Return additional field 'neargtcount' with a count of the incoming links (i.e. connecting lines from points with smaller value)
    - Better handling of the distance value for the feature with greatest value. Three options: "NULL", "1 Mio.", "max distance + 1".
    - Warn if the selected name field contains NULL or non-unique values
    - Add short help string
    0.1 (2022-09)
    - Initial version
